# FishCam Aquaponics Monitoring System

This project provides a comprehensive monitoring and notification system for an aquaponics setup, including sensor data collection, logging, web streaming, and automated email alerts.

## Main Components

### Sensor Modules

- **bme680_ts.py**: Reads temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure from a Bosch BME680 sensor via I2C.
- **liquid_level_sensor_ts.py**: Detects water/liquid level using a GPIO-connected sensor.
- **temp_water_sensor_ts.py**: Measures water temperature.
- **ph_sensor_ts.py**: Reads and calibrates pH sensor data, with command-line options for calibration and testing.

### Data Aggregation & Control

- **sensors_ts.py**: Main script for collecting sensor data, averaging readings, sending data to ThingSpeak, and managing email notifications.
- **sensors_with_scheduled_emails.py**: Enhanced version of `sensors_ts.py` with scheduled email capabilities and improved error handling.
- **scheduled_status_update.py**: Sends scheduled or daily summary status updates via email.

### Utilities

- **log_manager.py**: Interactive utility for managing, viewing, and cleaning log files.
- **email_notification.py**: Handles sending email notifications and alerts.
- **aquaponics_config.py**: Stores configuration constants (intervals, email settings, etc.).
- **api_key_ts.py**: Stores API keys (e.g., for ThingSpeak).
- **ph_calibrate.py**: Utility for calibrating the pH sensor and saving calibration data.

### Web Streaming

- **web_stream.py**: Runs a web server to stream live video from a camera using MJPEG.

### Other Files

- **ph_calibration.json**: Stores calibration data for the pH sensor.
- **html_templates/**: Contains HTML templates for email notifications and status reports.
- **logs/**: Directory for log files generated by the system.

## Usage

- Run `sensors_ts.py` to start sensor monitoring and notifications.
- Use `web_stream.py` to start the live camera stream.
- Use `log_manager.py` to view and manage logs.
- Calibrate the pH sensor with `ph_calibrate.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- GPIO Zero, bme680, requests, and other dependencies (see code comments for details)

## Purpose

This system is designed for real-time monitoring and management of aquaponics environments, providing robust data logging, alerting, and remote access via web and email.
