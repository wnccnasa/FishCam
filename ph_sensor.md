pH Sensor - Quick Setup
=======================

This project reads pH from a DFRobot Gravity pH probe V2 connected to a Grove
Base Hat (I2C ADC) on a Raspberry Pi.

Using the pH sensor (quick steps)
-------------------------------

1. Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi

   - Open a terminal on the Pi and run:

     sudo raspi-config

   - Navigate to: Interface Options -> I2C -> Enable

   - Reboot the Pi if prompted.

   You can verify the I2C device exists with:

     ls /dev/i2c-*

   and scan the bus for devices with:

     sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

     i2cdetect -y 1

2. Install Python dependency

   - Install smbus2 on the Pi:

     pip3 install smbus2

3. Run the quick test program

   - From the project directory on the Pi run:

     python ph_sensor_ts.py

Calibrating the pH probe (three-point calibration)
------------------------------------------------------

You'll need three calibration solutions: pH 4.00 (acid), pH 7.00 (neutral), and pH 10.00 (alkaline).

1. Rinse the probe in distilled water and gently blot dry.

2. Place the probe in the pH 7.00 solution and let it stabilize (30-60s).

3. Note the reported pH value from the program (or use the raw voltage).

4. Place the probe in the pH 4.00 solution and let it stabilize.

5. Note the reported pH value.

6. Place the probe in the pH 10.00 solution and let it stabilize.

7. Note the reported pH value.

From the three readings you can compute a more accurate calibration:

   measured_mv = measured_voltage - center_voltage (in mV)
   ph = slope * measured_mv + offset

For a linear calibration, use least-squares fitting with all three calibration points (pH 4, 7, and 10)
to determine the optimal slope and offset. This three-point approach provides better accuracy across
the full pH range compared to two-point calibration, especially for alkaline measurements.

## Notes and troubleshooting

- If you see warnings about I2C or Grove Base Hat during startup, they are
  often benign; verify the device appears in `i2cdetect` and that cables are
  seated correctly.

- Use `i2cdetect -y 1` to confirm you can see the Grove Base Hat on the bus.

- If readings are extremely noisy, increase the averaging sample count and
  ensure probe is clean and at stable temperature.

## Calibration helper script

This repository includes a small helper script `ph_calibrate.py` that computes
the linear slope and offset from two measured points. It is useful when you
have two known calibration solutions (for example pH 7.00 and pH 4.00).

### Examples (run on the Raspberry Pi)

- If you already converted to millivolts (centered around neutral):

```bash
python ph_calibrate.py --mv -10.5 -100.0 --ph 7.0 4.0
```

- If you measured raw ADC counts (0..4095) from the Grove ADC:

```bash
python ph_calibrate.py --raw 2048 1800 --ph 7.0 4.0 --center_voltage 0.306
```

The script prints `slope` and `offset`. Copy those values into
`ph_sensor_ts.py` as `PH_SLOPE` and `PH_OFFSET` (or keep them in a
configuration file) so the live readings use your calibrated conversion.

### Example output (illustrative)

```text
Calibration result:
  point A: mv=-10.500 mV -> pH=7.0
  point B: mv=-100.000 mV -> pH=4.0

  slope  = 0.031915  (pH per mV)
  offset = 7.335555
```

## Example calibration file

You can save calibration results to `ph_calibration.json` and the module will load it on import.
Create a file named `ph_calibration.json` in the project directory with content similar to this example:

```json
{
  "PH_SLOPE": -0.0169,
  "PH_OFFSET": 7.0,
  "CENTER_VOLTAGE": 0.306,
  "V_REF": 3.3,
  "ADC_MAX": 4095.0
}
```

Then run the sensor script; to print the loaded calibration use:

```bash
python ph_sensor_ts.py --show-calib
```
