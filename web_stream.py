# File: web_stream.py (OPTIMIZED VERSION)
# Author: William Loring
#
# Description:
#   This program creates a web server that captures video from a USB camera
#   and streams it live to web browsers. Students can view the camera feed
#   by opening a web browser and going to the server's address.
#
#   OPTIMIZATIONS FOR SPEED AND BANDWIDTH:
#   - Reduced default resolution to 640x480 (from 1280x720) for less bandwidth
#   - Added JPEG quality control (85% quality) to balance size vs quality
#   - Frame rate limiting to max 15 FPS to reduce bandwidth usage
#   - Camera warm-up sequence to reduce initial lag
#   - Optional known camera index to skip detection (faster startup)
#   - Responsive web page design with CSS styling
#   - Overlay label feature: displays "WNCC STEM Club" for 60 seconds every 15 minutes
#
#   This file is heavily commented for beginning Python programmers in a
#   community college setting. It explains programming concepts, real-world
#   hardware issues, and how web streaming works.
#
# Educational Topics Covered:
#   - Object-Oriented Programming (classes and methods)
#   - Threading (running multiple tasks at the same time)
#   - HTTP servers and web protocols
#   - Camera/video capture with OpenCV
#   - Error handling with try/except blocks
#   - Network programming basics
#   - Real-world troubleshooting and hardware limitations
#   - Performance optimization techniques
#   - Real-time image overlay and text rendering

# These are modules (libraries) that add extra features to Python

import logging  # For recording error messages and debug info
import os  # For file system operations and path handling
import re  # For regular expressions (pattern matching)
from logging.handlers import (
    TimedRotatingFileHandler,
)  # For rotating log files by day

# --------------------------- LOGGING SETUP -------------------------------- #
# Logging is like a diary for your program. It records what happens and any errors.
# This helps you debug problems and see what your code is doing.
#
# We use TimedRotatingFileHandler to create a new log file each day and keep 7 days of logs.
# Each log file will be named like
# 'web_stream.log', 'web_stream.2024-08-05.log', etc.

# Get the root logger
logger = logging.getLogger()

# Clear any existing handlers to prevent duplicates
logger.handlers.clear()

# You can change these to adjust the video quality and frame rate.

)

VIDEO_WIDTH = 1280

# Skip camera detection if you know your camera index (faster startup)
# Set to 0, 1, 2, etc. if you know your camera index, or None to auto-detect

    - Multiple inheritance (inherits from both ThreadingMixIn and HTTPServer)
    - Mixin classes (ThreadingMixIn adds threading capability)
    - Class attributes (variables that belong to the class, not instances)
    - Server architecture and design patterns

    ThreadingMixIn allows the server to handle multiple browser connections at once.
    Each client gets its own thread and can independently receive the MJPEG stream.
    The MediaRelay object is shared, but frame access is synchronized for thread safety.
